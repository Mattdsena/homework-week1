# Homework Week 1

# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Our Task

Our task was to resemble the mock up wesbite provided and ensure all links were working properly, as per the image below.

![Mockup example](https://github.com/Mattdsena/homework-week1/blob/main/assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

I first discovered the link to Search Engine Optimization wasn't working, so i fixed that link.

Following on from that, we also had to show an understanding of the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements.

I discovered that it all was non-semantic elements, this means is gives us no information about its content. So I changed all the dev to either section, article or aside just so it gave it a bit more structure.

Below you will find my Header, Article, Aside and Footer as they look on the website

![Article](https://github.com/Mattdsena/homework-week1/blob/main/assets/images/section-article-class-content.jpg)
![Aside](https://github.com/Mattdsena/homework-week1/blob/main/assets/images/section-aside-class-benefits.jpg)
![Footer](https://github.com/Mattdsena/homework-week1/blob/main/assets/images/Footer.jpg)

Once I believed the code followed a logical structure as reflected on the website, I moved onto naming the image and icon elements using the alt attributes and also renamed the website to be more descriptive. 

After that I went back through and double checked everything to the best I could & committed it to GitHub
